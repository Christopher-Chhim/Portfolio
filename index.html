            <img src="./assets/images/portrait.jpg" alt="picture of me" />
            <p>Hey everyone! My name is Christopher Chhim and I am an aspiring full-stack developer. I am mostly preoccupied with school, bootcamp, and extensive research. On my own time, 
                I like to play video games, watch anime, engage in recreational activities such as: playing board games, bowling, hanging out with friends, etc... I like getting to know
                new people and I like to spend a lot of time outdoors as well, given that I have a passion for traveling. While I do not play for a sports team in particular, I like to play
                soccer, volleyball, water polo, and basketball for fun.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I attended <a href="https://poly.lbschools.net/">Long Beach Polytechnic High School</a> throughout my 4 years of high school. I challenged myself by enrolling in the most 
            rigorous pathway -PACE- having a GPA requirement of 3.75 to join. From there, I took 11 AP courses and 5 Honors classes while also taking Chinese- the hardest foreign language.
            I graduated with a 3.4 GPA and currently attend <a href= "https://www.csulb.edu/">California State University, Long Beach</a> I am currently majoring in Computer Science as 
            an undergraduate student and my expected graduation date is May 2026.</p>

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>I aspire to become a full-stack developer in order to pursue my dreams. Growing up with technology, I grew interested in the realm of technology and wanted to 
                pursue my career because of my passion for video games. I also realize how technology is ever-developing and revolutionizing the world by its remarkable 
                renovations. I also like working with others towards a common goal, something I can achieve by working in groups in the professional field of technology.
